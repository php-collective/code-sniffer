This sniffer package follows [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) completely and ships with a lot of additional fixers on top (incl. PSR-12).
Please see the PhpCollective Coding conventions for details.

## Usage

### How to use in projects
Make sure you include the sniffer as `require-dev` dependency:
```
composer require --dev php-collective/code-sniffer
```

Then set up a `phpcs.xml` file in your project ROOT, e.g.:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ruleset name="your-app-name">
    <file>src/</file>
    <file>tests/</file>

    <rule ref="vendor/php-collective/code-sniffer/PhpCollective/ruleset.xml"/>

    <!-- Here you can add more or also silent existing ones -->
</ruleset>
```

### How to use in any project
You can manually invoke the phpcs/phpcbf commands:
```
vendor/bin/phpcs
vendor/bin/phpcbf
```
The command `phpcs` just sniffs, `phpcbf` fixes.

It is recommended to set up composer scripts to have shortcuts:
```
"scripts": {
    "cs-check": "phpcs -nps",
    "cs-fix": "phpcbf -nps"
}
```
Then you can run `composer cs-c` and `composer cs-f` and don't have to worry about the acronyms.

### Standards
You can always switch the standard to the stricter one named `PhpCollectiveStrict`.
It is an extension of the `PhpCollective` standard with its own (strict) sniffs added on top.

### How to include in your IDE
E.g. for PHPStorm:
* Open Settings -> Tools -> External Tools
* Add a new tool named "cs-sniffer" and set Program to `$ProjectFileDir$/vendor/bin/phpcs`, Parameters to `--standard=$ProjectFileDir$/vendor/php-collective/code-sniffer/PhpCollective/ruleset.xml -p $FilePath$` and Working directory to `$ProjectFileDir$`.
* Add a new tool named "cs-fixer" and set Program to `$ProjectFileDir$/vendor/bin/phpcbf`, Parameters to `--standard=$ProjectFileDir$/vendor/php-collective/code-sniffer/PhpCollective/ruleset.xml -v $FilePath$` and Working directory to `$ProjectFileDir$`.
* Remove the "Open console" if you don't want to see any output here for the fixer.
* Now set up your hotkeys under Settings -> Keymap (search for cs-sniffer and cs-fixer). E.g. `Control + Comma` for sniffing, and `Control + Dot` for fixing.

You can also set up file watchers, but here you should better only whitelist certain sniffs that only add things and don't remove anything.

### How to configure the default rule set

In order to simplify command line interface, `phpcs` allows to specify [default rule set](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Configuration-Options#setting-the-default-coding-standard) in and [standards path](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Configuration-Options#setting-the-installed-standard-paths) the following way.

Assuming the following directory structure:

```
vendor/php-collective/code-sniffer/                          # Base directory
                           |_ PhpCollective/                # Rule set name
                                      |_ ruleset.xml  # Rule set
```

The base directory and rule set can be used in configuration now.

```
vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths vendor/php-collective/code-sniffer/
vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set default_standard PhpCollective
```

You might need to specify full directory path. Now the tools can be used without `--standard` switch.

Make sure that you include the PhpCollective core standard ruleset in your custom one, e.g.:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ruleset name="PhpCollectiveProject">
    <description>
        PhpCollective Coding Standard for Project.
        Extends main PhpCollective Coding Standard.
        All sniffs in ./Sniffs/ will be auto loaded
    </description>

    <rule ref="vendor/php-collective/code-sniffer/PhpCollective/ruleset.xml"/>

    <!-- Define your own sniffs here -->
</ruleset>
```
If you want to use the `PhpCollectiveStrict` standard in your project, you should replace the string:
```xml
<rule ref="vendor/php-collective/code-sniffer/PhpCollective/ruleset.xml"/>
```
with this one:
```xml
<rule ref="vendor/php-collective/code-sniffer/PhpCollectiveStrict/ruleset.xml"/>
```
